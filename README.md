# Claude MCP Test

## Overview
This repository serves as a test application to explore the capabilities and limitations of the Claude Model Context Protocol (MCP). Through this project, I aim to experiment with Claude's ability to interact with external systems, manage data, and perform complex operations via its API integration capabilities.

## Purpose
The primary goals of this repository are to:

1. Test the range of operations Claude can perform using the Model Context Protocol
2. Explore how Claude can help in repository management and code creation
3. Document the effectiveness of using AI assistants for software development workflows
4. Push the boundaries of what's possible with modern AI-assisted development

## Project Structure
This repository will evolve as experiments progress, potentially including:
- Code samples demonstrating various API integrations
- Examples of Claude-generated solutions
- Documentation of successful techniques and limitations encountered
- Practical applications of AI-assisted development

## Contribution
This is a personal experimental project. However, observations and insights gained may be shared to help others understand the practical applications and boundaries of using Claude's MCP for development tasks.
