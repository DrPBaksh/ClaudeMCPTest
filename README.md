## How It Was Built
This entire application was created through Claude's Model Context Protocol without manual coding. Claude was able to:

1. Generate the complete file structure for a React application
2. Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with professional styling
3. Implement animations and interactive elements
4. Apply responsive design principles
5. Organize code following modern React best practices
6. Set up routing between multiple pages
